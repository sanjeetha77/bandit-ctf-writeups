# Bandit Level 11 â†’ Level 12

## **ðŸ§©** Challenge Description

The password for the next level is stored in the file `data.txt`, where all **lowercase (aâ€“z)** and **uppercase (Aâ€“Z)** letters have been **rotated by 13 positions**.

This encoding is called **ROT13** â€” a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 positions after it in the alphabet.

 **How it works:**

- A becomes N, B becomes O, ..., M becomes Z
- N becomes A, O becomes B, ..., Z becomes M
- The same applies to lowercase letters.

âœ… **Example:**

`Hello` â†’ `Uryyb`

`Uryyb` â†’ `Hello` (ROT13 is reversible!)

To decode, we use the `tr` (translate) command to map letters from Aâ€“Z to Nâ€“Z and Aâ€“M, and aâ€“z to nâ€“z and aâ€“m.

## ðŸ›  Commands You Might Use

- `ls -la` â€“ list all files
- `cat` â€“ display file contents
- `tr` â€“ translate or replace characters

## ðŸ’» Steps and Commands Used

```bash
# Step 1: List files in the directory
ls -la

# Step 2: Check the contents of data.txt
cat data.txt

# Step 3: Apply ROT13 decoding using `tr`
cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'

```
