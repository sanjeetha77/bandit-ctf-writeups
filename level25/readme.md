# **Bandit Level 24 ‚Üí Level 25**

---

## **üß© Challenge Description**

Logging in to **bandit26** from **bandit25** should be easy‚Ä¶ but the shell for `bandit26` is not `/bin/bash`.

Your task:

- Find out **what shell is used**.
- Understand **how it works**.
- Find a way to **break out of it** and get the **password for bandit26**.

---

## Explanation

In this level, we are provided with a private SSH key to log into `bandit26`, but the account is restricted with a custom shell (`/usr/bin/showtext`) that runs `more` to display a message. To bypass this, we exploit a feature in `more` that lets us launch the `vi` editor by pressing `v`. From `vi`, we can then execute `:e etc/bandit_pass/bandit26` to view the password for the next level or else you can type `:e set shell=/bin/sh` to go back to shell and then type  `:shell` to enter the shell and then use `ls` to display file contents and then find the password. Key concepts used here are SSH private key authentication, shell restriction bypass via `vi`, and privilege escalation through standard Linux tools.

And to ensure that the shell needs to minimize upto the extend and then press `v` to enter into the vim editor and can view the password.
