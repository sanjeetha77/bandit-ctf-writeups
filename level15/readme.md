# Bandit Level 14 ‚Üí Level 15

## **üß©** Challenge Description

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port `30000` on `localhost`.

---

## Explanation

- Once you have logged into the `bandit14` user (from the previous level using the private SSH key), you need to communicate with a service running locally on port `30000`.
- This can be done using the `nc` (netcat) command, which is a networking utility used for reading or writing data across network connections using TCP or UDP.
- To send the current level‚Äôs password to the service, you just have to pass it as input to `nc localhost 30000`.
- If the password is correct, the service will respond with the password for the next level.

## Strategy

1. Log in to `bandit14`.
2. Use `nc localhost 30000`.
3. Input the current password to receive the next level's password.
